      <p>
      I was okay about my current life, no one who I can tell my problems, updates and chikas.
      </p>
      <p>
      But I didn't realize that I was lonely until I met you. You are the one who always listen to me, give me advice and support me. I am so grateful to have you in my life. I hope we can be together forever and share all the good and bad moments together. I love you so much.
      </p>
      <p>
      I know that we have been through a lot of ups and downs, but I am willing to face all the challenges with you. I want to be your partner, your friend, your lover and your everything. I want to make you happy and be there for you whenever you need me. You are the most important person in my life and I will always cherish you.  
      </p>
      <p>
      I hope this letter can express my feelings and let you know how much I love you. You are the best thing that ever happened to me and I am so lucky to have you. I will always love you and be there for you no matter what. Thank you for being in my life and making it so wonderful. I love you more than words can say.
      </p>

        Forever yours,<br>
